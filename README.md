Woodies!
========

A simple site built with Meteor that displays all of the non-shirt items available on shirt.woot.com (hoodies, journals, totes, mugs, etc.) via the [Woot API](http://api.woot.com/).

You can view the app live at [woodies.meteor.com](http://woodies.meteor.com).

To run it yourself, simply rename settings.sample.json to settings.json, replace `YOUR_API_KEY`, and you're off!

*Please note: This app's code is pretty messy. It's getting better with each iteration, but it's very much a work in progress.*


### To-Do
\- Add main woot.com item to API request (sometimes it's a shirt detour)
