Woodies!
========

A simple site build with Meteor that displays only the hoodies and journals available on shirt.woot.com via the Woot API.

Rename settings.sample.json to settings.json, replace `YOUR_API_KEY`, and you're off!

*Please note: this site's code is ugly, unstructured, super wet (aka not DRY), and in general unpolished. It took me about an hour to write, and I plan to clean it up when time allows.*
